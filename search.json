    "text": "The data utilized in this analysis was originally sourced from Kaggle, which provided a comprehensive dataset detailing various aspects of Olympic athletes for the past 120 years.. To make the data more relevant and insightful, it underwent a thorough cleaning process. This involved refining the dataset to focus specifically on key attributes: ID, Sport, and Team. Additionally, the dataset was modified to include aggregated statistics such as Total Medals won by each athlete and the number of Olympics they attended.\nThe cleaning and modification steps aimed to enhance the clarity and usability of the data for further analysis. By emphasizing these specific attributes, the dataset now offers a clearer perspective on the athletes’ achievements and their Olympic careers. This approach not only streamlines the information but also provides a more focused view of the athletes’ performance across multiple Olympic Games"

    "text": "This project explores the relationship between a number of medals and Olympic athlete has earned, and the number of Olympics they have attended. Attempting to explain the longevity of an athlete’s Olympic career, we show over the past 120 years, the average medal per Olympics attended ratio, with swimming as an outlier, since it is easy to rack up the medals in swimming. Using Sport and Team as random variable we use a formula of Total_Medals ~ Olympics_Attended + Sport + Team. An athlete who has won at least one medal is approximately 20% more likely to attend another Olympics compared to an athlete who has not won any medals."
