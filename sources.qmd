The data utilized in this analysis was originally sourced from Kaggle, which provided a comprehensive dataset detailing various aspects of Olympic athletes for the past 120 years.. To make the data more relevant and insightful, it underwent a thorough cleaning process. This involved refining the dataset to focus specifically on key attributes: ID, Sport, and Team. Additionally, the dataset was modified to include aggregated statistics such as Total Medals won by each athlete and the number of Olympics they attended.

The cleaning and modification steps aimed to enhance the clarity and usability of the data for further analysis. By emphasizing these specific attributes, the dataset now offers a clearer perspective on the athletes' achievements and their Olympic careers. This approach not only streamlines the information but also provides a more focused view of the athletes' performance across multiple Olympic Games
